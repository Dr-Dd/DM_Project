Comparison of a RDBMS and Triplestore in the representation of IMDb's datasets.

## Premise

Let's imagine that we are a small cultural preservation consortium,
and we want to archive digitally the many movies in our possession. To
do so, we hire a software engineer to create a database for us. The
idea is not only to digitally save the movies in a filesystem, but
also be able to navigate the archive by filtering via the various
elements that compose a movie. Specifically, we are interested in the
following elements of a movie. Let's say he settles on a relation
database approach, and comes back with the following E-R diagram of
our archive after a few days.
